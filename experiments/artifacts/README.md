`fused_fee-3evo-LAYOUT-COMPATIBLE-not-a-vault-redesign.so` is a local build of the current fee-program source with only the program id set to `3EvoYD7bjAgr5evMJDbsLdyNU32zXgKiBycKruojYxpD`. It keeps the existing account seeds (`global`, `pool`, `qstat`, `cown`). It is not a vault redesign.

Do not upload the experimental `xa` / `xb` programs onto the funded 3Evo account. Their seeds are different, so that upgrade would leave the current vaults without a program that can sign for them.

Nothing in this folder has been deployed.
